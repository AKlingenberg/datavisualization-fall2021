## Pitch

### Are our elected officials actually representative? 

In more recent elections, the newest set of representatives and senators have been tauted as being the most representative of the American people yet, but does that actually mean the distribution of race, gender, and age within the House and Senate actually reflect the American people?

To help answer this question, the 2020 census data results would help inform on what the most recent make up of the country is in terms of racial diversity, age, location, and gender, among other factors. It would also be important to compile information on the current House of Representatives and Senate to figure out their demographic make up in order to compare them to their data on Americans as a whole. 

The census data was released within the last year, making the information the most accurate in terms of reflecting the country in 10 years. With midterm elections are approaching in 2022, this question is timely because it allows people to reflect on whether or not they truly feel represented.

For sources, it could be interested to speak to generation Z and millenial aged representatives at state or federal levels of government. I think speaking to underrepresented minority coalitions would also provide important perspective on how being represeted in more ways than just party alignment can be impactful. Your demographic background does make an impact on how you view issues. 

## Critique

### Clarity and Accuracy

["Clear Takeover: How Scientology doubled its downtown Clearwater footprint in 3 years"](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/)

Central Insight: 4/5 
  * The central insight was how quickly Scientology has expanded within the city of Clearwater Florida
  * Clear Takeover: How Scientology doubled its downtown Clearwater footprint in 3 years 

Data Visualization navigation: 3.5/5
  * You could only navigate the visualization by scrolling up and down
  * There was a bar on the side of the screen that showed where different text would be locate throughout the visualization, but you weren't able to jump ahead at all, so it would've been nice to be able to not have to actually scroll through the entire thing if you wanted to go back to any certain points. 

Data Accuracy: 3.5/5
  * I think particularly because of Scientology's secretive nature, it is difficult to know if the properties being acquired by parishoners are being used for Scientologist purposes. I think the article and the city council members that were interviewed assume it is, but very few of the scientologist property owners were willing to be a source. 
  * I know they did reach out to scientologists that purchased the different properties in downtown Clearwater, but only a few were willing to discuss but it would strengthen their argument if they had more of the business owners confirming that they were scientologists and they were buying the buildings at the discretion of the scientologist leadership. 
  * They used already collected data from the City of Clearwater's building commission and city councils. 
  * For the most part, yes they explained everything based on the information they had available to them. 

### Quality

Degree of quality: 4/5
  * The graphic is really clear and easy to understand. It makes sense and adds information in a way that aids the understanding of this story. However, the google earth image that they use to demonstrate the growing scientology foodprint is pixalated when they zoom in more. 

### Type and Color 

Type: 4/5
  * I think the article used a really clean sans serif font for the headline and subheaders which I think matches the tone they were striving for. It was very similar to the type used for Scientology's logo which works really well in terms of then connecting the article to the subject. The scrolling font used throughout the rest of the vasulization was a classic serif font which worked well and didn't compete with the more prominently used type. 

Color: 3/5
  * The headline and subheaders were all a grey color which made it a little hard to reach when they were over the dimmed photo. Otherwise, they did not do anything else interesting with the colors of the font. 

### Creativity 

Effectiveness: 4/5
  * The visualization was very clean, and did not have an excessive amount of creative elements, but the ones it did have were effective. It used different outlines through the scrolling to help the reader understand which areas they should be focusing on. The visualization is on a google earth photo of downtown Clearwater, Florida and it is a dimmed photo which as you scroll, lights up in certain areas to also draw the reader's eye towards what they want emphasized. Between the highlighted buildings and the outlined areas, it was very effective.
