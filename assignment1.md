## Pitch

### Are our elected officials actually representative? 

In more recent elections, the newest set of representatives and senators have been tauted as being the most representative of the American people yet, but does that actually mean the distribution of race, gender, and age within the House and Senate actually reflect the American people?

To help answer this question, the 2020 census data results would help inform on what the most recent make up of the country is in terms of racial diversity, age, location, and gender, among other factors. It would also be important to compile information on the current House of Representatives and Senate to figure out their demographic make up in order to compare them to their data on Americans as a whole. 

The census data was released within the last year, making the information the most accurate in terms of reflecting the country in 10 years. With midterm elections are approaching in 2022, this question is timely because it allows people to reflect on whether or not they truly feel represented.

For sources, it could be interested to speak to generation Z and millenial aged representatives at state or federal levels of government. I think speaking to underrepresented minority coalitions would also provide important perspective on how being represeted in more ways than just party alignment can be impactful. Your demographic background does make an impact on how you view issues.
